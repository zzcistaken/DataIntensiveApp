Once you have described the load on your system, you can investigate what happens when the load increases. You can look at it in two ways:

> When you increase a load parameter and keep the system resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, etc.) unchanged, how is the performance of your system affected?

> When you increase a load parameter, how much do you need to increase the resources if you want to keep performance unchanged?

Both questions require performance numbers, so let’s look briefly at describing the performance of a system.

In a batch processing system such as Hadoop, we usually care about throughput—the number of records we can process per second, or the total time it takes to run a job on a dataset of a certain size. In online systems, what’s usually more important is the service’s response time—that is, the time between a client sending a request and receiving a response.
