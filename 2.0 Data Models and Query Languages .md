Data models are perhaps the most important part of developing software, because they have such a profound effect: not only on how the software is written, but also on how we think about the problem that we are solving.

profound: 英 [prə'faʊnd] adj. 深厚的；意义深远的；渊博的

Most applications are built by layering one data model on top of another. For each layer, the key question is: how is it represented in terms of the next-lower layer? For example:

> As an application developer, you look at the real world (in which there are people, organizations, goods, actions, money flows, sensors, etc.) and model it in terms of objects or data structures, and APIs that manipulate those data structures. Those structures are often specific to your application.

sensor: 英 ['sensə] n. 传感器

model: 英 ['mɒdl] n. 模型；典型；模范；模特儿；样式 vt. 模拟；塑造；模仿

manipulate: 英 [mə'nɪpjʊleɪt] vt. 操纵；操作；巧妙地处理；篡改

> When you want to store those data structures, you express them in terms of a general-purpose data model, such as JSON or XML documents, tables in a relational database, or a graph model.

> The engineers who built your database software decided on a way of representing that JSON/XML/relational/graph data in terms of bytes in memory, on disk, or on a network. The representation may allow the data to be queried, searched, manipulated, and processed in various ways.

> On yet lower levels, hardware engineers have figured out how to represent bytes in terms of electrical currents, pulses of light, magnetic fields, and more.

----

figured out: 计算出; 估计; 想出; 理解

electrical current: 电流

pulse: 英 [pʌls] n. [电子] 脉冲；脉搏 vi. 跳动，脉跳

magnetic: 英 [mæg'netɪk] adj. 地磁的；有磁性的；有吸引力的

In a complex application there may be more intermediary levels, such as APIs built
upon APIs, but the basic idea is still the same: each layer hides the complexity of the
layers below it by providing a clean data model. These abstractions allow different
groups of people—for example, the engineers at the database vendor and the applica‐
tion developers using their database—to work together effectively.
