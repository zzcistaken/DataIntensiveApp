In Example 2-1 in the preceding section, region_id and industry_id are given as IDs, not as plain-text strings "Greater Seattle Area" and "Philanthropy". Why?

preceding: 英 [prɪ'siːdɪŋ] adj. 在前的；前述的

Philanthropy: 英 [fɪ'lænθrəpɪ] n. 博爱，慈善；慈善事业

If the user interface has free-text fields for entering the region and the industry, it makes sense to store them as plain-text strings. But there are advantages to having standardized lists of geographic regions and industries, and letting users choose from a drop-down list or autocompleter:

> Consistent style and spelling across profiles

> Avoiding ambiguity (e.g., if there are several cities with the same name)
