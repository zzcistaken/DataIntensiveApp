Everybody has an intuitive idea of what it means for something to be reliable or unreliable. For software, typical expectations include:

> The application performs the function that the user expected.

> It can tolerate the user making mistakes or using the software in unexpected ways.

> Its performance is good enough for the required use case, under the expected load and data volume.

> The system prevents any unauthorized access and abuse.

If all those things together mean “working correctly,” then we can understand reliability as meaning, roughly, “continuing to work correctly, even when things go wrong".

The things that can go wrong are called faults, and systems that anticipate faults and can cope with them are called fault-tolerant or resilient. The former term is slightly misleading: it suggests that we could make a system tolerant of every possible kind of fault, which in reality is not feasible. If the entire planet Earth (and all servers on it) were swallowed by a black hole, tolerance of that fault would require web hosting in space—good luck getting that budget item approved. So it only makes sense to talk about tolerating certain types of faults.
