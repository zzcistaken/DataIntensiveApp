Most application development today is done in object-oriented programming languages, which leads to a common criticism of the SQL data model: if data is stored in relational tables, an awkward translation layer is required between the objects in the application code and the database model of tables, rows, and columns. The disconnect between the models is sometimes called an impedance mismatch.

criticism: 英 ['krɪtɪsɪz(ə)m] n. 批评；考证；苛求

awkward: 英 ['ɔːkwəd] adj. 尴尬的；笨拙的；棘手的；不合适的 

impedance: 英 [ɪm'piːd(ə)ns] n. [电] 阻抗

----

Object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks like ActiveRecord and Hibernate reduce the amount of boilerplate code required for this translation layer, but they can’t completely hide the differences between the two models.

boilerplate: 英 ['bɒɪləpleɪt] n. 样板文件；引用

For example, Figure 2-1 illustrates how a résumé (a LinkedIn profile) could be expressed in a relational schema. The profile as a whole can be identified by a unique identifier, user_id. Fields like first_name and last_name appear exactly once per user, so they can be modeled as columns on the users table. However, most people have had more than one job in their career (positions), and people may have varying numbers of periods of education and any number of pieces of contact information. There is a one-to-many relationship from the user to these items, which can be represented in various ways:

> In the traditional SQL model (prior to SQL:1999), the most common normalized representation is to put positions, education, and contact information in separate tables, with a foreign key reference to the users table, as in Figure 2-1.

> Later versions of the SQL standard added support for structured datatypes and XML data; this allowed multi-valued data to be stored within a single row, with support for querying and indexing inside those documents. These features are supported to varying degrees by Oracle, IBM DB2, MS SQL Server, and PostgreSQL [6, 7]. A JSON datatype is also supported by several databases, including IBM DB2, MySQL, and PostgreSQL [8].

----

varying: 英 ['vɛəriŋ] adj. 不同的；变化的

> A third option is to encode jobs, education, and contact info as a JSON or XML document, store it on a text column in the database, and let the application interpret its structure and content. In this setup, you typically cannot use the database to query for values inside that encoded column.

For a data structure like a résumé, which is mostly a self-contained document, a JSON representation can be quite appropriate: see Example 2-1. JSON has the appeal of being much simpler than XML. Document-oriented databases like MongoDB [9], RethinkDB [10], CouchDB [11], and Espresso [12] support this data model.

Some developers feel that the JSON model reduces the impedance mismatch between the application code and the storage layer. However, as we shall see in Chapter 4, there are also problems with JSON as a data encoding format. The lack of a schema is often cited as an advantage; we will discuss this in “Schema flexibility in the document model” on page 39.

The JSON representation has better locality than the multi-table schema in Figure 2-1. If you want to fetch a profile in the relational example, you need to either perform multiple queries (query each table by user_id) or perform a messy multiway join between the users table and its subordinate tables. In the JSON representation, all the relevant information is in one place, and one query is sufficient.

sufficient： 英 [sə'fɪʃ(ə)nt] adj. 足够的；充分的

----

The one-to-many relationships from the user profile to the user’s positions, educational history, and contact information imply a tree structure in the data, and the JSON representation makes this tree structure explicit (see Figure 2-2).

i. A term borrowed from electronics. Every electric circuit has a certain impedance (resistance to alternating current) on its inputs and outputs. When you connect one circuit’s output to another one’s input, the power transfer across the connection is maximized if the output and input impedances of the two circuits match. An impedance mismatch can lead to signal reflections and other troubles.
