Now that we have discussed the parameters for describing load and metrics for measuring performance, we can start discussing scalability in earnest: how do we maintain good performance even when our load parameters increase by some amount?

earnest: 英 ['ɜːnɪst] adj. 认真的，热心的；重要的 n. 认真；定金；诚挚

in earnest: 认真的；诚挚地；正经的

An architecture that is appropriate for one level of load is unlikely to cope with 10
times that load. If you are working on a fast-growing service, it is therefore likely that
you will need to rethink your architecture on every order of magnitude load increase
—or perhaps even more often than that.
