If you have worked in software engineering in recent years, especially in server-side and backends systems, you have probably been bombarded with a plethora of buzzwords relating to storage and processing of data. NoSQL! Big Data! Web-scale! Sharding! Eventual consistency! ACID! CAP theorem! Cloud services! MapReduce! Real-time!

----
bombard: 英 [bɒm'bɑːd] 美 [bɑm'bɑrd] vt. 轰炸；炮击

plethora: 英 ['pleθ(ə)rə] 美 ['plɛθərə] n. 过多；过剩；[医] 多血症 

buzzword: 英 ['bʌzwɜːd] n. 流行词

Sharding: n. 分片；分区

Eventual consistency: 最终一致性  最终一致  一致性

In the last decade we have seen many interesting developments in databases, in distributed systems, and in the ways we build applications on top of them. There are various driving forces for these developments:

> Internet companies such as Google, Yahoo!, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, Microsoft, and Twitter are handling huge volumns of data and traffic, forcing them to create new tools that enable them to efficially handle such scale.

> Business need to be agile, test hypotheses cheaply, and respond quickly to new market insights by keeping development cycles short and data models flexible.

> Free and open source software has become very sucessfull and is now preferred to commercial or bespoke in-house software in many environments.

> CPU clock speeds are barely increasing, but muti-core processors are standard, and networks are getting faster. This means parallelism is only going to increase.

> Even if you work on a small team, you can now build systems that are distritued across many machines and even mutiple geographic regions, thanks to infrastructure as a service (IaaS) such as Amazon Web Services.

> Many services are now expected to be highly available; extended downtime due to outages or maintenance is becoming increasingly unacceptable.

Data-intensive applications are pushing the boundaries of what is possible by making use of these technological developments. We call an application data-intensive if data is its primary challenge--the quantity of data, the complexity of data, or the speed at which is changing -- as opposed to compute-intensive, where CPU cycles are the bottleneck.

The tools and technologies that help data-intensive applications store and process data have been rapidly adapting to these changes.

intensive: 强化的，加强的；密集的
