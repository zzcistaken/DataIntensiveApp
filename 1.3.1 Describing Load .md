First, we need to succinctly describe the current load on the system; only then can we discuss growth questions (what happens if our load doubles?). Load can be described with a few numbers which we call load parameters. The best choice of parameters depends on the architecture of your system: it may be requests per second to a web server, the ratio of reads to writes in a database, the number of simultaneously active users in a chat room, the hit rate on a cache, or something else. Perhaps the average case is what matters for you, or perhaps your bottleneck is dominated by a small number of extreme cases.

To make this idea more concrete, let’s consider Twitter as an example, using data published in November 2012 [16]. Two of Twitter’s main operations are:

> Post tweet
  A user can publish a new message to their followers (4.6k requests/sec on average, over 12k requests/sec at peak).
  
> Home timeline
  A user can view tweets posted by the people they follow (300k requests/sec).
 
Simply handling 12,000 writes per second (the peak rate for posting tweets) would be fairly easy. However, Twitter’s scaling challenge is not primarily due to tweet volume, but due to fan-out—each user follows many people, and each user is followed by many people. There are broadly two ways of implementing these two operations:

> Posting a tweet simply inserts the new tweet into a global collection of tweets. When a user requests their home timeline, look up all the people they follow, find all the tweets for each of those users, and merge them (sorted by time). In a relational database like in Figure 1-2, you could write a query such as:

SELECT tweets.*, users.* FROM tweets 
JOIN users ON tweets.sender_id = users.id 
JOIN follows ON follows.followee_id = users.id
WHERE follows.follower_id = current_user

> Maintain a cache for each user’s home timeline—like a mailbox of tweets for each recipient user (see Figure 1-3). When a user posts a tweet, look up all the people who follow that user, and insert the new tweet into each of their home timeline caches. The request to read the home timeline is then cheap, because its result has been computed ahead of time.

The first version of Twitter used approach 1, but the systems struggled to keep up with the load of home timeline queries, so the company switched to approach 2. This works better because the average rate of published tweets is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the rate of home timeline reads, and so in this case it’s preferable to do more work at write time and less at read time.

two orders of magnitude ：个数量级, 两个量级, 二个数量级

preferable: 英 ['pref(ə)rəb(ə)l] adj. 更好的，更可取的；更合意的

However, the downside of approach 2 is that posting a tweet now requires a lot of extra work. On average, a tweet is delivered to about 75 followers, so 4.6k tweets per second become 345k writes per second to the home timeline caches. But this average hides the fact that the number of followers per user varies wildly, and some users have over 30 million followers. This means that a single tweet may result in over 30 million writes to home timelines! Doing this in a timely manner—Twitter tries to deliver tweets to followers within five seconds—is a significant challenge.

significant: 英 [sɪg'nɪfɪk(ə)nt] adj. 重大的；有效的；有意义的；值得注意的；意味深长的

In the example of Twitter, the distribution of followers per user (maybe weighted by how often those users tweet) is a key load parameter for discussing scalability, since it determines the fan-out load. Your application may have very different characteristics,
but you can apply similar principles to reasoning about its load.

The final twist of the Twitter anecdote: now that approach 2 is robustly implemented, Twitter is moving to a hybrid of both approaches. Most users’ tweets continue to be fanned out to home timelines at the time when they are posted, but a small number of users with a very large number of followers (i.e., celebrities) are excepted from this fan-out. Tweets from any celebrities that a user may follow are fetched separately and merged with that user’s home timeline when it is read, like in approach 1. This hybrid approach is able to deliver consistently good performance. We will revisit this example in Chapter 12 after we have covered some more technical ground.
